Anna Karenina, Clarissa Dalloway, Daisy Buchanan...each seems to live on the page through celebrated artist Samantha Hahn's evocative portraits and hand lettered quotations, with the pairing of art and text capturing all the spirit of the character as she was originally written. The book itself evokes vintage grace reimagined for contempary taste, with a cloth spine silkscreened in a graphic pattern, debossed cover, and pages that turn with the tactile satisfaction of watercolor paper. In the hand and in the reading, here is a new classic for the book and art lover's library.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.4;\"\u003eHardcover, 107 pages with full-color illustrations\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e","brand":"Hachette Book Group","offers":[{"title":"Default Title","offer_id":1812573635,"sku":"101888","price":19.95,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0877\/4476\/products\/WellReadWomenEdit.jpeg?v=1432665774","url":"http:\/\/shop.lfla.org\/products\/well-read-women","provider":"The Library Store","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
