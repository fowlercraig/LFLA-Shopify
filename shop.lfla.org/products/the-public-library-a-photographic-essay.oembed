Today, the more than 17,000 libraries in America also function as de facto community centers offering free access to the internet, job-hunting assistance, or a warm place to take shelter. And yet, across the country cities large and small are closing public libraries or curtailing their hours of operation. Over the last eighteen years, photographer Robert Dawson has crisscrossed the country documenting hundreds of these endangered institutions. The Public Library presents a wide selection of Dawson's photographs - from the majestic reading room at the New York Public Library to Allensworth, California's one-room County Free Library built by former slaves. Accompanying Dawson's revealing photographs are essays, letters, and poetry by some of America's most celebrated writers. A foreward by bill Moyers and an afterword by Ann Patchett bookend this important survey of a treasured American institution.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.4;\"\u003eHardcover\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.4;\"\u003e192 pages with full color images\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e","brand":"Hachette Book Group","offers":[{"title":"Default Title","offer_id":1812545091,"sku":"106035","price":35.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0877\/4476\/products\/ThePublicLibrary.jpeg?v=1432665688","url":"http:\/\/shop.lfla.org\/products\/the-public-library-a-photographic-essay","provider":"The Library Store","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
