These marvels include the energetic, the audacious, and the ludicrous. They consist of wholesale master plans; buildings of all types; parks, civic squares, green spaces, and public gathering points; monuments and follies, including some hilariously farcical amusement parks; and transit designs stretching in all directions over land and sea, adopting every foreseeable technology from monorail to flying bus. Through these never-built schemes, authors Sam Lubell and Greg Goldin explore the \"what if\" Los Angeles, investigating the values and untapped potential of a city that, to this day, is trying to solve the riddle of what it wants to become.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.4;\"\u003eHardcover, 375 pages with full color pictures.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e","brand":"Perseus","offers":[{"title":"Default Title","offer_id":1812595267,"sku":"100801","price":55.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0877\/4476\/products\/NeverBuiltEdit.jpeg?v=1432665857","url":"http:\/\/shop.lfla.org\/products\/never-built-los-angeles","provider":"The Library Store","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
