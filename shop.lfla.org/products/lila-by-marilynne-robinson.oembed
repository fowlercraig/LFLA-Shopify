She becomes the wife of a minister and widower, John Ames, and begins a new existence while trying to make sense of the days that preceded her new-found security.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeglected as a toddler, Lila was rescued by Doll, a canny young drifter, and brought up by her in a hardscrabble childhood of itinerant work. Together they crafted a life on the run, living hand to mouth with nothing but their sisterly bond and a ragged blade to protect them. Despite bouts of petty violence and moments of desperation, the times they shared were laced with joy. After Lila arrives in Gilead, she struggles harmonize the life of her makeshift family and their days of hardship with the gentle Christian worldview of her husband, which paradoxically judges those she loves.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRevisiting the beloved characters and setting of Marilynne Robinson's Pulitzer Prize-winning \u003cem\u003eGilead\u003c\/em\u003e and\u003cem\u003eHome\u003c\/em\u003e, a National Book Award finalist, \u003cem\u003eLila \u003c\/em\u003eis a moving expression of the mysteries of existence that is destined to become an American classic.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.4;\"\u003eHardcover \u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.4;\"\u003e272 pages\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e","brand":"MPS","offers":[{"title":"Default Title","offer_id":1812465795,"sku":"107306","price":26.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0877\/4476\/products\/LilaEdit.jpeg?v=1432665466","url":"http:\/\/shop.lfla.org\/products\/lila-by-marilynne-robinson","provider":"The Library Store","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
