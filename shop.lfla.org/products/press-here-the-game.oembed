Herve Tullet has reimagnied his groundbreaking book in an entirely new dimension. Players take turns completing color sequances by placing red, blue, and yellow playing pieces on one of twenty-five fabulously designed game boards. What seems like a simple choice is likely to lead to animated discussion as players come to understand the visual logic at the heart of the game. With two levels of play to choose from - so that it's easy enough for a toddler to grasp, but also complex enough to challenge older siblings and adults - this engaging game delivers hours of entertainment for the whole family.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e25 double-sided cards and 90 playing pieces\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAges 3 and up.\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e","brand":"Hachette Book Group","offers":[{"title":"Default Title","offer_id":1812608835,"sku":"106618","price":19.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0877\/4476\/products\/PressHereTheGAme.jpeg?v=1432665918","url":"http:\/\/shop.lfla.org\/products\/press-here-the-game","provider":"The Library Store","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
