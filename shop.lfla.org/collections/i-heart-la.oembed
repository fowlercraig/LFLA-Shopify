Through seventy reproductions of seminal and historic documents, Los Angeles in Maps presents the evolution of this almost mythical place. Maps featured include historic maps from the early days of the pueblo that would become Los Angeles, to more recent, yet no less fascinating topographic surveys, tourist guides, real estate maps, bird's-eye views, and more. Winding naturally, like the course of the Los Angeles River, the book passes through essential terrain: the discovery of oil, the rise of Hollywood, the streetcar system, the Sleepy Lagoon murder and Zoot Suit riots, Los Angeles Harbor, earthquakes, sprawl, and splendor. \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlen Creason is Map Librarian at Los Angeles Public Library\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.4;\"\u003eHardcover, full color images\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.4;\"\u003eAutographed copy\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.4;\"\u003e192 pages\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e","brand":"Random House","offers":[{"title":"Default Title","offer_id":1812572483,"sku":"007698","price":50.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0877\/4476\/products\/SpineLosangles.jpeg?v=1432665769"},{"product_id":"los-angeles-mug","title":"Los Angeles Mug","description":"\u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis BIG coffee mug was inspired by Los Angeles' BIG coffee culture.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e15 oz.\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSold individually\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePrinted in Los Angeles with soy based inks\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHand wash only\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e","brand":"Sisters of Los Angeles, L","offers":[{"title":"Default Title","offer_id":1812617155,"sku":"101454","price":16.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0877\/4476\/products\/LosAngelesMugEdit.jpeg?v=1432665949"},{"product_id":"los-angeles-set-of-8-boxed-notes","title":"Los Angeles Set of 8 Boxed Notes","description":"\u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSlow down the Los Angeles pace for a minute to send some old fashioned correspondence. \u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.4;\"\u003eCreated from original art work by Anna Bond.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.4;\"\u003eSet of 8 A2 notecards and envelopes\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.4;\"\u003e5 1\/2\" x 4 1\/4\"\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.4;\"\u003eMade in the USA\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e","brand":"Rifle Paper Co.","offers":[{"title":"Default Title","offer_id":1812591875,"sku":"105458","price":18.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0877\/4476\/products\/LosAngelesCards.jpeg?v=1432665837"},{"product_id":"los-angeles-sunrise-to-sunset","title":"Los Angeles Sunrise to Sunset","description":"\u003cp\u003ePhotography by Dain Blair\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLos Angeles is a place of wonder.

Richardson Banks says she is a collector of memories more than a photographer. \"A real photographer,\" she says, \"owns a 'real' camera. I just take snapshots with my iPhone; mostly of temporary things that I love and don't want to forget.\" Collectively, her images reveal an insider's glimpse into her urban neighborhood transformed by artists in the early 1980s and now quickly gaining widespread popularity. Seemingly, the point of view for each shot is more of someone who has lost a loved one than a tourist taking photos on vacation. A pile of bricks covered in graffiti from a demolished industrial building, luscious blossoms against stark concrete, blinding rooftop sunsets, skies crisscrossed by power lines, serpentine wire twirled around iron fences, and the promise of a new day as the sun rises over historic bridges are among the many images that evoke the sense of a place more pastoral or even more exotic than what you'd expect to find in the center of the nation's second largest metropolitan area.

With more than 200 menus - some dating back to the nineteenth century - culled from thousands in the Menu Collection of the Los Angeles Public Library, \u003cstrong\u003eTo Live and Dine in L.A.\u003c\/strong\u003e is a visual feast of a book. \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it's more. Much more. \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this detailed history, author Josh Kun riffs on what the food of a foodie city says about place and time; how some people eat big while others go hungry, and what that says about the past and \u003cem\u003enow\u003c\/em\u003e. Kun turns to chefs and cultural observers for their take on modern: Chef Roy Choi sits down long enough to say why he writes \"some weird-ass menus.\" Pulitzer Prize-winning critic Jonathan Gold looks at food as theater, and museum curator Staci Steinberger considers the design of classic menus like Lawry's. Restauranteur Bricia Lopez follows a Oaxacan menu into the heart of Koreatown.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe city's leading chefs remix vintage menus with a 21st-century spin: Joachim Splichal, Nancy Silverton, Susan Feniger, Ricardo Diaz, Jazz Singsanong, Cynthia Hawkins, Micah Wexler, Ramiro Arvizu and Jaime Martin del Campo cook up the past with new flavors. And, of course, the menus delight: Tick Tock Tea Room, Brown Derby, Trumps, Slapsy Maxie's, Don the Beachcomber, and scores more. \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKun tackles the timely and critically important topic of food justice, an shows how vintage menus teach us about more than just what's tasty, and serve as guides to the politics, economics, and sociology of eating. \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmerica is a dining-out nation, and our research indicates that L.A. has long been one of its top dining-out towns. The Library's collection is a living repository of meals past, an archive of urban eating that tells us about the changing historical role of food in the city, which is to say it tells us about just about everything that food touches: economics, culture, taste, race, politics, architecture, class, design, industry, gender, to name just some of the themes that recur on menu pages. \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKun challenged contributors to tackle subjects that readers may have not contemplated. As the renowned L.A. chef Roy Choi points out in his Forward to \u003cstrong\u003eTo Live and Dine in L.A.\u003c\/strong\u003e:\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"\u003eThe more I looked at the menus, the more they told me about the city and how neighborhoods developed. But it was the menus that I couldn't find that forced me to ask questions about how life really was. I started to think about how the city is now and if those missing menus were a reflection of life just as it is now. Were these menus of the affluent and middle-class? Were the working classes even eating with menus, or were they mostly eating at stand and carts? Were there disparities and access problems just like today?\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.4;\"\u003e224 pages, full color throughout\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.4;\"\u003eHardcover\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Library Foundation of LA","offers":[{"title":"Default Title","offer_id":2256192067,"sku":"109890","price":45.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0877\/4476\/products\/ToLiveandDineinLA.jpg?v=1433443141"}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0877\/4476\/collections\/CoasterandBag.jpg?v=1432836665","url":"http:\/\/shop.lfla.org\/collections\/i-heart-la.oembed","provider":"The Library Store","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
