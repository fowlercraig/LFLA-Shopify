Over the course of this wildly energetic narrative, the underpass transforms from art deco emblem into no-man's-land into art project, reflecting (and sometimes challenging) the city's changing values of beauty, ownership, and civic pride. Most of all, Under Spring uproots our complacency about disposable, discarded spaces, offering in its stead a groundbreaking vision of culture and community. \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.4;\"\u003eSoftcover, 97 pages, full color images\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e","brand":"HEYDAY BOOKS","offers":[{"title":"Default Title","offer_id":1812579779,"sku":"108635","price":20.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0877\/4476\/products\/Cover.jpeg?v=1432665797","url":"http:\/\/shop.lfla.org\/products\/under-spring-voices-art-los-angeles","provider":"The Library Store","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
