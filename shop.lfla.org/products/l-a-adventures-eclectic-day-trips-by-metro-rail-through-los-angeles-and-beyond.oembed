L.A. Adventures makes it easy and fun to discover Los Angeles in ways you never thought possible - by rail, by bike and by imagination. With fourteen easy to follow day trips for every budget and interest, plus three bike tours to get your blood moving, L.A. Adventures debunks the myth of Los Angeles as a must-have-a-car-city.

Along the way you’ll uncover the city's best kept secrets. Did you know you can listen to the world's largest church organ for free? Get a traditional Akasuri Korean body scrub at three in the morning? Or lunch on imaginative Mexican-fusion cuisine prepared by reformed gang members? L.A. Adventures takes you step-by-step from sunrise to sunset - what to see, where to eat and how to get there without burning a gallon of gas, or battling freeway traffic. Touring L.A. has never been easier. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSoftcover, sold individually\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e278 pages\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"collapsePS\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"swSprite s_collapseChevron\"\u003e\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/div\u003e","brand":"LA Electric Travel Books","offers":[{"title":"Default Title","offer_id":1812566979,"sku":"101875","price":18.95,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0877\/4476\/products\/L.A.Adventures.jpeg?v=1432665749","url":"http:\/\/shop.lfla.org\/products\/l-a-adventures-eclectic-day-trips-by-metro-rail-through-los-angeles-and-beyond","provider":"The Library Store","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
