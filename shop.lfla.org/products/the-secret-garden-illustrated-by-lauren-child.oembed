Spoiled and self-absorbed, Mary soon finds that the mansion is not so empty as it seems at first and gradually learns that world does not revolve around her, and is filled with wonderful living things and people who can become friends.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLocked away behind a wall Mary discovers the Secret Garden, abandoned and neglected, and with the help of Dickon, a local boy as at home with the wildlife and plants of the moor as with the livestock and garden of his family's small farm, she begins to tend the garden. And as the garden begins to recover and bloom with the spring, so too does Mary, finding the meaning of friendship and the warmth of human companionship.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe most remarkable transformation, though, is the change that comes over her cousin Colin, sickly and feeble, hidden away from the world in his private room and expecting death.
