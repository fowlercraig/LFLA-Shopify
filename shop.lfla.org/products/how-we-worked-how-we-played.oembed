After relocating to Los Angeles from the East Coast in 1937, Herman and his wife Ethel explored their newly adopted home, far and wide. By the end of the decade, he had snapped well over 5,000 photos. \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow We Worked, How We Played: Herman Schultheis and Los Angeles in the 1930s, presents a small sampling of this amazing collection which was donated to the Los Angeles Public Library following Ethel's death in the early 1990s. The images present an overview of a rapidly expanding city in the midst of the Great Depression and on the verge of a world war, along with the simple story of two people in love with each other - and Los Angeles.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThis catalog was published in conjunction with \u003c\/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"http:\/\/www.lapl.org\/whats-on\/exhibits\/how-we-worked-how-we-played-herman-schultheis-and-los-angeles-1930s\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHow We Worked, How We Played: Herman Schultheis and Los Angeles in the 1930s\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/a\u003e\u003cspan\u003e, a photo exhibit on display in the Central Library History \u0026amp; Genealogy Department November 1, 2012 - May 24, 2013.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.4;\"\u003ePaperback, sold individually\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.4;\"\u003e149 pages\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.4;\"\u003ePrinted in the USA\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e","brand":"Photo Friends of Los Ange","offers":[{"title":"Default Title","offer_id":1812567171,"sku":"101765","price":15.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0877\/4476\/products\/Cover_de4e51d3-d652-4256-9965-81bb409db6ab.jpeg?v=1432665751","url":"http:\/\/shop.lfla.org\/products\/how-we-worked-how-we-played","provider":"The Library Store","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
