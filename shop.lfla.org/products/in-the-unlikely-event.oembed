Against this backdrop of actual events in the early 1950s, when airline travel was new and exciting and everyone dreamed of going somewhere, Judy Blume imagines and weaves together a haunting story of three generations of families, friends, and strangers, whose lives are profoundly changed by these disasters. She paints a vivid portrait of a particular time and place - Nat King Cole singing \"Unforgettable,\" Elizabeth Taylor haircuts, young (and not-so-young) love, explosive friendships, A-bomb hysteria, rumors of Communist threat. And a young journalist who makes his name reporting tragedy. Through it all, one generation reminds another that life goes on. \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the Unlikely Event is a gripping novel with all the hallmarks of Judy Blume's unparalleled storytelling. \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.4;\"\u003eHardcover\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.4;\"\u003eSigned Bookplate\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.4;\"\u003e416 pages\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e","brand":"Baker and Taylor","offers":[{"title":"Default Title","offer_id":3161462083,"sku":"109959","price":27.95,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0877\/4476\/products\/IntheUnlikelyEvent.jpg?v=1434999796","url":"http:\/\/shop.lfla.org\/products\/in-the-unlikely-event","provider":"The Library Store","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
