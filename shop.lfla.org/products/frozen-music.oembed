{"product_id":"frozen-music","title":"Frozen Music","description":"\u003cp\u003eIn Frozen Music the art of architecture meets the art of literature. The result is page after page, from novels, memoirs, essays, and poetry, of vivid, thought-provoking, and ceaselessly entertaining work by California's best writers. \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the Spanish missions to present-day builings to futuristic visions, Frozen Music moves from romantic to speculative, comedic to philosophical. Whether it's John Fante's description of the collapse of the brick Alta Loma Hotel or Paul Goldberger's comparison of Frank Gehry's Disney Hall to a musical instrument, Frozen Music offers us not just new ideas but a language with which to describe them. \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAuthors:\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt Andersen, Jaime de Angulo, Anne and Arthur Bloomfield, Gray Brechin, Herb Caen, Ernest Callenbach, Alan Cartnal, Mike Davis, Robert Duncan, John Fante, William Gibson, Brendan Gill, Harold Gilliam, Paul Goldberger, Daniel P.
